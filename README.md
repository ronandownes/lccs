Hypothesising, making predictions, examining evidence, recognising patterns and reaching conclusions are at the heart of computer science. In this applied learning task, students will identify an interdisciplinary topic, develop a hypothesis and utilise existing resources to highlight the salient information and inform future decisions. By identifying, analysing, and deconstructing a problem, students will deepen their understanding of practices and principles of computer science.

| Analytics; Abstraction            | Develop algorithms that can find the frequency, mean, median and mode of a data set |
| Data collection and analysis      | Structure and transform raw data to prepare it for analysis                  |
| Interpretation of data            | Represent data to effectively communicate in a graphical form                |
| Algorithms                        | Use algorithms to analyze and interpret data in a way that informs decision-making |
